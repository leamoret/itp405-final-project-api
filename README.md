Project Starter.

- What is your site about?
My site a platform on which people can see art made by refugees and give them feedback. The website will display photos of art pieces and users can leave feedback on the photos. The website will also display the list of artists who have made one piece or more.
The feedback will be used by artists to better their art and as a metric to judge which art has the best reviews and will eventually be shown in exhibitions.

- What types of users?
People visiting the site do not have to have an account. They are art amateurs who want to leave feedback and keep track of artists to participate in deciding which ones will make it to the final exhibition.

- What can users do?
Users can leave comments on the art piece. Users can also endorse a particular artist.

- What can the admin do?
The admin can add and delete art pieces and artists.

- What api are you using?
 I will be using my own api that had get, put, post, and delete functions.

- What are the tables?
There will be three tables: artists, pieces, and reviews.
